url_finding_task:

    Task: {task_description}

    Your job is to identify the base URL (domain only, no path) of the web application where the workflow should begin. 
    You can use web search to find the application, then navigate to verify it's the correct site.
    Return ONLY the base URL without any path (e.g., "https://example.com" NOT "https://example.com/path").

    Tool Usage Guidelines:
      - Use web_search_url_tool("<task_description>") to find the base URL of the application (domain only).
      - Use navigate_page_and_take_screenshot_tool("<base_url>") to visit and verify it's the correct application.
      - Use capture_ui_snapshot_tool() to confirm the page is the correct application.
      - Return ONLY the base domain URL, no paths or query parameters.

    Reasoning Style:       
      - Begin by searching the web with web_search_url_tool(<task_description>) to find potential entry URLs.
      - Navigate to the most relevant candidate using navigate_page_and_take_screenshot_tool().
      - Capture the UI with capture_ui_snapshot_tool() to verify that the visible interface
        aligns with the user’s intent (e.g., workspace, project list, dashboard, etc.).
      - Stop once you have found a page that visually confirms the correct starting point.
      - If the page does not match expectations, try another URL from the search results.

    Example:
      Task: "Invite a teammate in <website_name>"
      Thought: I should find the <website_name> workspace URL where sharing actions are available.
      Action: web_search_url_tool("Invite a teammate in <website_name>")
      Observation: Top result shows https://<website_name>.com.
      Thought: The url should be https://<website_name>.com.
      Action: navigate_page_and_take_screenshot_tool("https://<website_name>.com")
      Observation: The workspace dashboard with a "Share" button is visible.
      Thought: This is the correct starting point for inviting teammates.
      Final Output: Navigated to https://<website_name>.com.

  expected_output: >
    Return a short string confirming the navigation to the verified base URL (domain only, no path).  
    Example 1:
      Final Output: Navigated to https://example.com.

    IMPORTANT: Return ONLY the base domain URL without any path.
